## Overview
When people seeks a job they often search in the jobs in LinkedIn, but we noticed that   when a new position becomes available, employees are often tasked with finding potential candidates who meet the job requirements, So we decided to help people find the job and in the same time help employees to increase their chances of earning bonuses, If a candidate recommended by an employee is hired, the referring employee typically receives a bonus as recognition for their contribution, employees often share job postings on LinkedIn in search of suitable matches so we want to develop AI-driven solutions that analyze these posts to identify potential matches. By automating the matching process, we aim to facilitate smoother and more effective job discovery for both job seekers and matching candidates for jobs. Moreover, in our project one of the significant advantages of the matching process is that the person who finds the job post suitable for him can send his cv to the employee who shared the post who can apply him for the job and this increases his chances to be accepted for the job.
